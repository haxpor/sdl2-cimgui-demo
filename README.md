# Usage

Use

* `make` to build with `gl3w` backend (gl3w's header and source provided in source)
* `make glew` to build with `glew`. Make sure you installed `glew` on your system.

# Note

- With help of suggestion from [#78](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui/issues/78), and [#79](https://github.com/cimgui/cimgui/issues/79).
- Focus testing on macOS only, not on Windows or Linux. Modify `Makefie` as needed for those platforms.

# TODO

* [ ] Add `imgui`, and `cimgui` as 3rd source via git submodule then modify `Makefile` to build whole thing. For better sync with update, and specific commit.
